I am excited about the Sentence class I coded today.  It seems like it could be a useful tool to help writers explore granular aspects of their writing. It is fun making choices about what parts of a sentence are important, and what attributes a Sentence class should have.

I am a bit worried that I am overengineering this project.  Even if it is, it is good practice in organization.  It is interesting to think about natural language components as Python objects.

I am excited about having a set of classes that inherit the properties of the Document class.  I will have a journal class which has time-based sentiment analysis.  I will have an essay class which will have a property of a document length goal, as well as a method to identify repeated phrases and ideas.  I will have a poem class which describes number of lines, and perhaps common phonemes.

I wonder if I am actually going to finish this project, or at least get an MVP completed.  I have a lot of ideas, and some coding done, but I question the actual utility of the project.  Will it be useful to anyone other than me?  Will it be useful to me?

I've taken a bit of time away from this project.  I went to Memphis for a long weekend.  The Civil Rights Museum, Sun Studio, and Stax were incredible.  The soul food at 4 Way and Alcenia's were some of the best meals I've had.

I hope to regain some momentum on this project in the coming weeks.  I'm excited about where the Journal class could be heading.

I am adding sentiment analysis to the Sentence class.  While I am doing that, I am becoming more familiar with NLTK's functions and classes.  I am worried I might be replicating their work, which would be bad.  But, I am pushing ahead despite my reservations.  I think I will learn something no matter what by working on this project.  Hopefully, it will provide an accurate snapshot of my coding skills.
